                I'm a 5th (and final) year student studying a Bachelors of Mechanical
                Engineering (Honours) / Bachelors of Computer Science at UNSW in Sydney,
                with a high distinction average.

                I have a keen interest in lower sytems programming, and espeacially love
                writing programs in Rust or, with the occasional dash of C++. On the
                mechanical engineering side, am most interested in studying the
                mechanics/motion of sytems and fluids. Right now I am conducting my
                honours thesis on Computional Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

                My primary motivation is a initate curosity and desire to understand how
                things actually work, often supported by abosrding every morsel of
                knowledge I can off those around me. This is not just true for my
                displines of engineering and computer science, but for all facets of my
                life.
