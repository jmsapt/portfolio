  description: "
    This is project is was you are viewing *right now*. The primary goal of this project was to learn a frontend web framework and gain some basic
    design skills. The website was built using the [Svelte Javascript Framework](https://svelte.dev) and hosted on Github Pages.

    It also lets me express my experience in a more complete and aesthetic way then a simple pdf resume.

- name: Game of Life
  description: "
    This project was just a small proof of concept web application for working with 
    Rust code compiled down to web assembly, and interfacing with Javascript.
    The application itself is a simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
    where the lifecyle of each cell is governed by 4 simple rules.
    
    The simulation is entirely written in Rust, and interfaces with Javascript for rendering on the webpage in one direction, and passing
    user input from webpage back to the simulation in the other direction. The web assembly binary can interface with the Javascript
    as the Rust program declares a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) that is provided by Rust. This allows for Javascript to call Rust
    functions, and even allows memory to be shared between the Javascript and Rust.

    To use the simulation, you can click random to generate a new random grid, click on individual cells to toggle them, toggle between running/paused, and change the simulation's
    speed using the slider. To reset the universe you can click new blank.

- name: Computation Fluid Dynamics for the Web
  description: "
    This project is my current thesis project for my mechanical engineering honours. The aim is to develop a lightweight 3D Computational Fluid 
    Dynamics (CFD) fluid simulation program that could be built into web assembly allowing it to be easily distributed via a website. The target audience 
    for it is highschool to university student, providing them with an easy to use and less computationally intensive program by using 
    a solver and by only simulating incompressible flow. 

    One of the primary motivations behind this thesis topic was it would give me a reason to learn how to program for
    the GPU, and how to write compute shaders. Rendering is handled by the Rust game engine [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org).

    Right now it is early days, with my it starting in February and ending in November.

- name: UNSW Sunswift Racing
  description: "
    UNSW's [Sunswift Racing](https://www.challeng.unsw.edu.au/challeng-projects/sunswift-racing) is a student lead engineering project that designs
    and build solar cars. They have been building solar cars since 1996, with the current car being Sunswift Racing 7 (SR7). I was a member Vechile Dynamics department
    from August 2022 to September 2023.

    During my time with the team, I helped improve and maintain SR7 in preparation for the 2023 Bridgestone World Solar Challenge in October of 2023, where solar cars race across Australia starting in Darwin 
    ending in Adelaide. Sunswift Racing finished the event winning our division ([Bridgestone World Solar Challenge Results](https://worldsolarchallenge.org/the-event/history/honour_roll)).
    The team also managed to set a [new world record](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-19/solar-powered-car-unsw-sunswift-7/101790478), becoming the fastest electric 
    car to travel more than 1,000 kilometres on a single charge.
